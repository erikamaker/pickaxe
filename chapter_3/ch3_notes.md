# QUICK UPDATES 

I backtracked and went through the first chapter for properly installing the newest Ruby (3.2.1) using rbenv. I started chapter 3 shortly after. I'm also going to begin using all my notes in README format, with titles and appropriately spaced example breaks. 


# DEFINING CLASSES

I learned that a good first step in designing object-oriented systems is to identify the 'domain concepts' we are using. I take 'domain concepts' to be part of the 'modeling' nature of objected-oriented programs. So, the domain concept can be something in the physical world, a known and abstracted process, or any other entity that makes sense for the team working with it. 


```
class BookInStock
end

a_book = BookInStock.new
another_book = BookInStock.new
```


Both of these instances have different object_ids, but will otherwise behave very much the same. They don't yet have any instance variables or other held information. The `initialize` method sets the state of each of these object during construction (`.new`). This individualized state is stored using instance variables. We can update the definition to include this state: 


```
class BookInStock
  def initialize(isbn, price)
    @isbn = isbn
    @price = Float(price)
  end
end
```


By calling new, Ruby allocates some memory to hold an uninitialized object, then initializes its state. By doing so, it passes all the arguments that are passed to `new`. That data is the instance's state. 

In this case, the `initialize` method takes two parameters. They act like variables local to the method (and follow the same naming conventions). However, if they were truly just local variables, they would disappear when the `initialize` method returns. 

To preserve them, we can pass them into instance variables as arguments. Even though `@isbn` and `isbn` look very similar, they are not equivalent. We are merely assigning the information passed at initialization to the instance variable, preserving its (mutable) state. 

In the class, the Float method takes the argument price and converts it to a floating-point number. It's worth noting that there are better ways to write this, because we shouldn't be holding prices in trailing floats--this is just to illustrate how the class works). 

This parameter will accept anything for `price`, as long as it can be converted to a float. An integer, another float, or even a string containing (only) the representation of a float, will all work. 


# OBJECTS AND ATTRIBUTES

The internal state is private to the instances we defined in the last exercise. No other object can access the instance variables holding that state. There is no such thing as perfect privacy in Ruby. Does this mean it's not a good language for security under some contexts, or all contexts? 

I learned that if an object is completely private, you can't do anything with it. Methods let you access and manipulate the instance variables in an object, which allows the global scope of the program to interact with it. These more visible parts, like instance variables, are its attributes. 

Accessor methods help us to learn the state of objects. 


```
class BookInStock
  def initialize(isbn, price)
    @isbn = isbn
    @price = Float(price)
  end
  def isbn
    @isbn
  end
  def price
    @price
  end
  # ..
end

book = BookInStock.new("isbn1", 12.34)
puts "ISBN = #{book.isbn}"
puts "Price = #{book.price}"


=> 
ISBN = isbn1
Price = 12.34
```


In the example above, we can access the instance variables @isbn and @price with the methods `isbn` and `price`. The following quote felt disorienting to read: 

"As far as other objects are concerned, thereâ€™s no difference between calling these attribute accessor methods and any other method. This is great because it means that the internal implementation of the object can change without the other objects needing to be aware of the change" 

I've read it multiple times and I'm not following. What 'other objects' are we referring to? Other instances of the same class? Entirely separate classes? 


```
class BookInStock
  attr_reader :isbn, :price                 # attr_reader creates the methods that we otherwise individually wrote in example 3.                                 above
  def initialize(isbn, price)
    @isbn = isbn
    @price = Float(price)
  end
  # ..
end

book = BookInStock.new("isbn1", 12.34)

puts "ISBN = #{book.isbn}"                  # With attr_reader, they're already made for you through its one-line-implementation. 
puts "Price = #{book.price}"
```


Using a symbol, like :isbn and :price, we are referencing the state that was provided by attr_reader. I remember that, and was reminded by the text, that symbols are used to reference a name. In this context, `:isbn` means the name `isbn`, which in turn represents the value of the variable `@isbn`. The accessor methods we wrote in the earlier exercise are identical to the reader method using symbols in the most recent one. However, a reader method only allows you to read it--not to change it. 


# WRITING TO ATTRIBUTES

By the way, the attr_reader declaration does not declare instance variables. It creates accessor methods, but the variables don't need to be declared. The instance variables automatically have a value of nil when accessed, unless the value is assigned another way. Other languages restrict access to instance variables, making a need for setter functions. In the text, a snippet of Java was used, showing that there is a private method for setting the price, and a public method for getting the price. In Ruby, the attributes can simply be accessed with the getter method. 

From the text:    "In Ruby, the attributes of an object can be accessed via the getter method and that access
looks the same as any other method." This is another instance of the sentence that confused me on my first readthrough. I'm not sure what is meant by "looks the same as any other method". 

To create a getter method that accesses the attributes, a Ruby method is written that ends with an equals sign, like the below example: 



```
class BookInStock
  attr_reader :isbn, :price
  def initialize(isbn, price)
    @isbn = isbn
    @price = Float(price)
  end
  def price=(new_price)
    @price = new_price
  end
  # ...
end

book = BookInStock.new("isbn1", 33.80)
puts "ISBN = #{book.isbn}"
puts "Price = #{book.price}"
book.price = book.price * 0.75 # discount price
puts "New price = #{book.price}"

=>
ISBN = isbn1
Price = 33.8
New price = 25.349999999999998
```

The method .price= is an assignment invoking the price=() method. Here, it's reassigning the original price value to equal itself multiplied by .75, which has been passed as an argument on line 16. The ruby interpreter ignores the whitespace between the end of the name and the equals sign. The instance variable's value is now updated to the new price. 

`book.price=(1.50)` is also idiomatically written `book.price = 1.50`. A shortcut for write-only is to use attribute writer. However, most people want to use both, so attribute accessor is the standard. I'm not fully understanding why we have attr_reader for :isbn-- wouldn't it be quicker to just say: 

``` 
attr_accessor :isbn, :price
```

I suppose ISBN isn't going to change, so it makes sense not to make it accessible to write over. Still, I'm thinking, if the same people are working on this program, and there aren't any other methods that write over :isbn, would it make sense to write it with attr_accessor referencing both? Or would that cause confusion?
 

```
class BookInStock
  attr_reader :isbn                    # will only access to READ the value. 
  attr_accessor :price                 # will access to both READ and WRITE TO the value. 

  def initialize(isbn, price)
    @isbn = isbn
    @price = Float(price)
  end
  # ...
end
```


# ATTRIBUTES ARE JUST METHODS WITHOUT ARGUMENTS

The attribute-accessing methods have more functionality. For instance, I can update the exact number of the trailing floats in the earlier example with `.round`. The text talked a bit about multiplying the price by 100 and rounding it, to get the best price representation in dollars and cents. It also recommended using BigDecimal and not Float for financial calculations before discussing the possibility of creating writing methods that are parallel to the reader method. 

In exercise 8, a new method `price_in_cents=(cents)` is created. The text explains that the first method (without the `cents` argument) doesn't actually correspond to an instance variable. Using the Uniform Access Principle, we're benefiting from the difference between an instance variable vs calculated values. 

The first `price_in_cents` method calculates a value using the accessed value `price`. It's only reading the value of price, and making a new return value based on a simple calculation INVOLVING `price`'s VALUE, but not the actual instance variable itself. 

The second method is accepting `cents` as an argument to actually set a new value to the instance variable `@price`. I experimented by removing the @ symbol from the instance variable @price, and found that the 1234 value of line 24 means nothing to instance without it.


# ATTRIBUTES, INSTANCE VARIABLES, AND METHODS

The text says that, at this point, I may think that attributes are nothing more than methods. An attribute /is/ a method. Sometimes an attribute just gives you the value of an instance variable, sometimes it returns the result of a calculation, and sometimes it updates the instance's state. 

What makes something an attribute vs a regular method? Context, I think. External state intended to be viewable is an attribute. The internal state that's concealed is an instance variable. Other actions that the class can perform are regular methods. The text says there isn't a huge need to know the difference yet.


# CLASSES WORKING WITH OTHER CLASSES 

I've been excited to get to this. The text briefly explained intent for reading the CSV files we made at the start of the file. It reiterated the point that, in OO design, we identify external things and model our code after them. For instance, it talked about how our program was meant to handle multiple CSV files, and suggested we keep an array of values in an instance variable. I learned that Ruby comes with a good CSV library built in (we cover it more in Chapter 29). 

The CVS file reader class requires a file called "cvs", to find any files with that name. An instance variable is made at initialization that accepts data about the books. This data is parsed from the CSV files as a set of key / value pairs. The ISBN and Price columns are derived from these columns and rows, and used as the needed arguments to create a new BookInStock object. This object is instantiated and appended to the `@books_in_stock` array. 

This nearly was over my head, but I realized the book is trying to tell me what types of patterns to aim for. In general, the `initialize` method will set up the object's environment by giving it an accessible state. The point is to make it so that other methods can use that state. The exercises that I made and ran were all to prime me for this fully functional program that we're about to build. It's going to have the definition of the class BookInStock in one file, the CsvReader file, and a main runner file. I'm going to get building, and will report back after. 


# THOUGHTS ON THE BOOKS IN STOCK PROGRAM

I'm stuck. I can't seem to get the driver file to run like the text expects it to. I've read / reread / double checked the directory. I am swapping `csv_file_name` with the actual csv file. I've also tried leaving it exactly as it is and keep getting the same error. I've also tried changing `require_relative` to `require ./filename.rb`. I changed and swapped a few things around, reverted back to the original format, and can't seem to get past this: 


```
ruby stock_stats.rb data.csv 
stock_stats.rb:1:in `require_relative': cannot load such file -- /home/erikamaker/pickaxe/chapter_3/books_in_stock/csv_reader (LoadError)
	from stock_stats.rb:1:in `<main>'
```

I'm going to keep at this until I can get the program running. I'm currently about 7 pages from the end of this chapter, but I don't want to move on until I have this program funcitoning like it should. 

# 1 WEEK LATER. . . SPECIFYING ACCESS CONTROL 

Okay, back on track. This section of the text starts off urging me to consider how much of a class is exposed to the rest of the program. I learned that allowing too much access risks codependency of other classes (or 'coupling'). Controlling access to the methods is controlling access to the object, since this is the only way to change an object's state in Ruby. 

There are three different levels of accessing control, including public methods (accessible by anyone with zero access control enforcement--this is default, excepting the private method `initialize`), protected methods (which are invoked only by class and subclass objects that define it), and private methods, which cannot be called by an outside receiver, as the receiver is limited to the context of itself (there are ways around this that we'll learn about in 19 chapters). 

"Protected" vs "Private" is subtle, and notably different in Ruby compared with other OO languages. If a method is protected, any instance of the class (or its subclasses) can invoke it. However, if a method is private, it's only accessible within the context of calling the object itself (e.g. `door_1.open` isn't accessible by every door instance, but `self.open` is). 

Access control is determined while the program runs, which means it's determined dynamically rather than statically when it's interpreted. An access violation will occur when the code tries to execute a restricted method. 

> Quick question-- doesn't "while the program runs" mean "as it's interpreted"? Am I misunderstanding something here? 

Access levels are specified within the class (or module of defined behavior) with `public`, `protected`, and `private`. There are three ways to use them: 

 If called without arguments, the three functions set default access control in the following way (note that they look like keywords, but are actually methods): 
 
 
```
 class SomeClass
 # default is "public" 
   def method1
     # is public
   end
 
   protected
   # subsequent methods will be protected.
 
   def method2
     # like this one
   end
 
   private 
   # subsequent methods will be private 
 
   def method 3
     # like this one
   end
 
   public
   # subsequent methods will be public. 
 
  def method4
    # like this one
  end 
  # is public
end
```

I guessed, and was validated by the text shortly after, that `public` is rarely called, since it's the default access control level for a method. These levels of control can also be set across methods by listing them as arguments: 


```
class SomeClass
  def method1
  end
  def method2
  end 
  ... 
 
  public :method1, :method4
  protected :method5
  private: method 3
end
```


The text explains what happens here. I think it's pretty obvious, but worth stating: the class's methods are being passed as arguments by the access control methods. The text says it's rare to declare access like this.

I was curious why they're passed as symbols, though. I read a little bit of the documentation but couldn't find the area that covers this specific answer myself. I knew that symbols are referenced values that can be passed like any other value-- but why not pass it as the method name itself? 

It turns out a newbie developer named Hal Friday wondered the same thing in 2020.He also references where to find it in the documentation, but I found his explanation more thorough and easier to understand. 

Article: https://dev.to/halented/passing-functions-as-arguments-in-ruby-5b5i

Documentation: https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.6/Object.html#method-i-method

> It is imperative to notice that you must pass the function through as a symbol when you are ready to send it along... The symbol terminology is Ruby's built-in way to allow you to reference a function without calling it.

This is important, because Ruby will attempt to execute the passed method if it isn't a symbol. In short, it instead references it rather than executing it. I think this is correct anyway, but let me know if I have that wrong at all. 

Side Note with some Knowledge Gaps: 

He also mentions this is because ruby is a "synchronous language", which I had to Google, only to learn that it means the language is more "reactive" and that it instantaneously / deterministically reacts to input events from its environment. 

How would this compare to other languages? A source said that asynchronous is multi-thread (operations can run in parallel), while synchronous runs only one at a time. Does that have anything to do with the difference between interpreting a language line-by-line rather than compiling it? 

Oh! The book is mentioning this implementation now too. It says that defining a method with `def` returns a value ( "the name of the new method as a symbol" ). I'm glad I read a little more though, becuase I think that would have confused me if I hadn't. 

You can also declare access directly before a method definition like this: 


```
protected def method2
  # this method is protected
end
```


Here, the method is returning the value :method2 that's immediately passed as an argument to protected. This makes it so that only this method is protected. This form is the text's preference, because access is more explicitly applied to each method. The first form is the more conventional, but older, way. 

The text ran through some examples for modeling an accounting system. In this program, each debit corresponds to a credit, and should never break form. To ensure this, we can make methods that return the debits and credits privately, while defining our external interface via transactions. 

I created and digested the small program with comments throughout. It was pretty straightforward and fun to play around with. I tried crashing it by calling private methods rather than going through the accessible public method, which worked exactly like I thought it would. 

Protected access is used when objects need to access the internal state of other objects of the same class. Two account objects can compare their balances directly, but they can hide those balances from the rest of the program. Toggling `protected` on the accessor method for `@balance` broke it similarly. 

# VARIABLES 

Variables are used to keep track of objects. They each reference an object. This is something Ian and I worked through together when he first offered his help in analyzing my understanding of encapsulation. A program's instance of an object holds a place in memory. A variable references it. 

For instance, an object like the following states that the object in `person` is a string object referencing a specific spot in memory, with a value of `"Erika"`. 


```
person = "Erika"
```


The text asks whether a variable is an object. In Ruby, the answer is "no", as a variable is just a reference to a separate object. The place in memory, and its held value, is pointed to by the variable. They do not hold the object themselves. For instance, assigning `person1` to another variable `person2` wouldn't create anything new, it would just make another variable that points to the same object. 

The book shows an illustration that was very similar to the one Ian made for me a couple weeks ago. I think this concept is super straightforward. I learned that the assignment _aliases_ an object, which means you can have multiple named variables referencing the same object in memory. 

The text explains this can cause problems, but not very often, even in other languages. You can even avoid aliasing by using the `dup` method. It creates a new object with identical contents like so: 


``` 
person1 = "Tim" 
person2 = person1.dup
```


You can also prevent a certain object from changing by freezing it. Trying to alter it will raise a RuntimeError exception. Numbers and symbols are always frozen. I felt this intuitively, so it was a fun "click" in my head to see this written in the text. 

# Reopening Classes 

Something unique about how Ruby's classes are structured: You can re-open a class definition and add new methods or variables at any time-- even classes that are part of a third-party tool or the standard library included with Ruby. This was really exciting to read. I played around with it a little bit. 

This is colloquially known as "monkey-patching". Does this mean that, whenever I redefine a class definition, I'm monkey-patching? The text says it's common (reasonably) to do this in order to add utility functions to core classes. RoR is said to do this a lot (for instance, I learned how the method `str#squish` removes (excessive) whitespace).

I thiiink this means I might have redefined Ruby's standard method `open` to instead funciton specifically for my own game's engine (i.e. opening containers). I wonder if this will cause a problem later on. According to the documentation, it's for opening files and other input-output functions. 

In essence, I can always reopen a class, to add or change existing methods. This conveniently lets my work flow, without needing to know which methods might already be defined. But, it should be done with caution, since some teams don't allow it in their code unless there's an imperative reason to. Also, monkey-patching to change behavior of existing methods, rather than adding new methods, can cause unpredictable behavior. 

I definitely can see why this would, after reading the chapter. I know of a few spots in my own engine that monkey-patch a bit. As I refactor, I'm going to keep in mind that doing so to avoid unwanted global changes. There is another way to reopen and update classes, but with less ability to change them (refinements). 

Everything (that you can manipulate) in Ruby, is an object. An Object's life starts as an instance of a class. Everything points back to Object eventually. Next up, we're learning about creating collections of objects!
